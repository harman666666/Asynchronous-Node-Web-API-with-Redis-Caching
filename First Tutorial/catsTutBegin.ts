var _ = require('lodash');


/*
 So, lodash is great. It's a utility class, it's a utility module that does a lot of things 
 on arrays and collections, so like map reduce and find and all those types of things so you 
 don't have to kind of write those algorithms yourself. 

 npm install lodash cause we need to use the module: npm install --save lodash
 lodash only library used more than express
