Adding intellisense
Typings, the type definition manager for TypeScript, makes it easy to search for and install TypeScript
definition files into your workspace. This tool can download the requested definitions from a variety
of sources, including the DefinitelyTyped repository. As we did with the Express Generator, we will install
the Typings command line tool globally using NPM so that you can use the tool in any application you create.

npm install -g typings
Tip: Typings has a number of options for configuring where and how definition files are downloaded.
From the terminal, run typings --help for more information.
Go back to the file app.js and notice that if you hover over the Node.js global object __dirname,
VS Code does not know the type and displays any.

Now, using the Typings command line, pull down the Node.js and Express type definition files:

$ node_modules/.bin/typings install dt~body-parser --global --save
$ node_modules/.bin/typings install dt~express --global --save
$ node_modules/.bin/typings install dt~node --global --save
$ node_modules/.bin/typings install dt~serve-static --global --save
$ node_modules/.bin/typings install dt~express-serve-static-core --global --save
$ node_modules/.bin/typings install dt~mime --global --save

typings install dt~lodash --global --save
typings install dt~mongoose --global --save
typings install dt~request --global --save
typings install dt~async --global --save
typings install dt~redis --global --save

best way to install typings is to open packages.json, look at dependencies and install

Click on the Configure gear icon at the top of the Debug view to create a default launch.json configuration
file and select Node.js as the Debug Environment. This configuration file lets you specify how to start the
application, what arguments to pass in, the working directory, and more. The new launch.json file is created
in a VS Code specific .vscode folder in root of your workspace.

     the pipe to the server that made the request, or to the client that made the request, and it's going to end the response.
     And then this callback function gets instantiated and run every time someone hits the server, and then I tell it to listen on
     port 3000 on my localhost(127.0.0.1).

//I dont want to be writing headers, and making these low level calls, so need a framework, thats why we need express
//Express handles both front end and backened, templating

 It handles front-end and back-end, so it can do templating and send Jade files,
 which translates into HTML or pure HTML so you can use it for your front and your back-end.
 So lets use express module

-g => Yeah, and it puts it in your path so that whenever you're in your terminal you can actually use,

 I am going to be sending data back and forth from the express app
 express is barebones, its just a simple server that allows you to set and built out a server with endpoints

 Things like parsing the body and parsing cookies, those are all left to plugins
 node small compartementalized functionality, you can add what you want

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Node is geared toward being a middle man, like an air traffic controller
You really just want backend services that do the number crunching and data processing
So node itself is a single event loop, and so google V8 which node runs on top of, is threaded
So you can have threaded processes, you can do exec, you can spawn processes, but Node itself has a single event loop.
If you're coming through in that event loop and you start doing some really heavy processing here,
like let's say I had 10,000 cats, and I wanted to then take those cats and I want to arrange them alphabetically by
like maybe 20 parameters deep, like sorting them ---. So what you're saying is that, if I hear you right, with the
single event loop, that's why we have callbacks everywhere, right? Correct. So, go figure this out. When you're ready,
I'll catch you on the next iteration of the loop. But if I stop and I pause and I make you process all that data, then
we're slowing down everybody else. Yes. Okay, so how do we fix that? So, the way that this should be architected, and
especially in a lot of businesses now, is you already have some back-end services that do a lot of different things.
Right, you've got .NET, Java, whatever. Yeah, and I've got a new client application that needs some data, but it could
be a mobile app or whatever, and I don't need to be sending all of this data, and I don't want to hit all these
different endpoints. So where Node really shines is putting it in between, right? As a web API right at the edge
of your network. So, all these databases that already exist and all of these services that already exist, I can go
and aggregate and orchestrate and then send back just what I need for my client. So that's pretty cool because a
lot of places, you know I've done a lot of consulting in my career, and I know you have too, they already have a
lot of applications in the back-end. Let's say it's all .NET. They've got stuff that they've written for years.
And usually when an app or a project comes up, have said, hey, go add a new UI to this, or go add this new feature,
but you can't change the back-end systems. Not easily. So this would allow you to say, look, financially we can't
change everything. Leave the back-end systems there, and if I hear you right, you're going to put Node in front of
those. So it's not doing the heavy number crunching. It's deferring that to the other places, and then Node acts as
like an aggregator? Aggregator, orchestrator. Those are the architectural terms. Again, I like to think of it as
an air traffic controller. So it's between your .NET and your glass, your screens. Yeah, I don't need to send back
this 10,000 JSON document that I got from my service to my web application, right, and I don't want to change the
service to trim and get the specific data I need, but I can use this in between to get from service A, B, and C,
and just send down what I need. Why not just go right to .NET in this case? Why Node? Just Node, first of all, is
written in JavaScript, so it's very easy for people who are working in the front-end to become accustomed to it
and to write with it. And it's simple. I mean, look at how quick we wrote this. I defer to you because you have a
lot of .NET experience. I don't have a whole lot of .NET experience, but ---. Well, yeah, I could easily go back
and say, well, I know .NET very well, I could write a web API very quickly, but it sounds like, and in my experience
this has been true, and tell me because you have more of it than I have, when I create a Node server that it's really,
because of the event loop and all that, it's really built for that fast I/O. I mean faster than if I crank something
up with Java or .NET, I'm going to have to deal with even more server stuff going on, and it just, it seems to be a
little more bulky. Larger memory footprint. It does more. A larger memory footprint, yeah. But Node seems to be
like I need to get fast I/O, boom, boom, boom, I can run through it. Okay, basically Node is that great middle
layer air traffic controller, you call it? Air traffic controller. And then we use our back-end. Okay, so we'll
agree there, .NET in the back-end, Node in the middle. Well, I would say Go in the back-end, but you know me.
That'll be the next one.
